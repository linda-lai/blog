      <p>
        Hi, hello, hey! I'm Linda. Programming, puns and people - that's my jam. After feeling restless and dissatisfied with my career trajectory a few years ago, I began dipping my toes into digital and development eating the world today, found the water was warm, and haven't look back. I took the plunge and recently completed a Diploma of Information Technology at Coder Academy learning full-stack with Ruby/Rails, JavaScript and the MERN stack.

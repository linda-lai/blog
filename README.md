# < LindaLogical />, a blog built in Gatsby

I've been meaning to create a blog *and* play with Gatsby, so downtime over the holidays provided the perfect opportunity. Tentatively and but hopefully trying to write more about my interests and current projects, or at the very least use the blog to document my personal progress, or anything that piques my interest.

I used Gatsby's [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) boilerplate to start, and added my own styles along the way using CSS Modules. I leaned on the docs for additional configurations and extensions, and after some initial getting used to, found myself really enjoying Gatsby, with solid documentation to boot. Appreciated the versatility of GraphQL queries. Big tick for developer experience.

I'm happy with what I've come up with so far, but definitely hope it improve and refine it further, if I can keep the writing and maintenance up. Fingers crossed.

Off we go, 2020!

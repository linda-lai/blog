# Gatsby Blog

I've been meaning to create a blog *and* play with Gatsby, so downtime over the holidays provided the perfect opportunity. Tentatively but hopefully will write more about my interests and current projects, or at the very least use the blog to document my personal progress, or anything that piques my interest.

I used Gatsby's [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) boilerplate to start, and added my own styles along the way using CSS Modules. I leaned on the docs for additional configurations and extensions, and after some initial getting used to, found myself really enjoying Gatsby, with solid documentation to boot.

I'm happy with what I've come up with so far, but definitely hope it improve and refine it further, if I can keep the writing and maintenance up. Fingers crossed.

## Running Locally
To run the blog locally, install related dependencies:
```
(npm | yarn) install
```

Start the development server:
```
npx gatsby develop || yarn run develop
```
